# Introduction

An enterprise must:

* Store every relevant data point about their business
* Give data access to everyone who needs it
* Have the ability to analyze the data in different ways
* Distill the data down to insights

Most enterprises have data warehouses for analytics purposes. In the past, building and running a warehouse was complicated. Enterprises had to hire database administrators to keep their queries running fast and protect against data loss.
