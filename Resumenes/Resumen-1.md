# Introduction

An enterprise must:

* Store every relevant data point about their business
* Give data access to everyone who needs it
* Have the ability to analyze the data in different ways
* Distill the data down to insights

Most enterprises have data warehouses for analytics purposes. In the past, building and running a warehouse was complicated. Enterprises had to hire database administrators to keep their queries running fast and protect against data loss.

# Introducing Amazon Redshift

Cloud data warehouses like Amazon Redshift changed how enterprises think about data warehousing by dramatically lowering the cost and effort from deploying data warehouse systems without affecting its performance.
