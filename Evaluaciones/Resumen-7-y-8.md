## Use Cases for Graph Technology

When your data is complex, the solution is in the graph. **Neo4j** helps the world make sense of data by identifying connections and plotting relationships otherwise unseen amidst never-ending strams of data.

### 1. Fraud Detection

Storing voluminous transaction detail in a graph database captures connections that already exist. The data is then ripe for graph-native machine learning techniques that surface fraud.

### 2. Real-Time Recommendations

To be relevant and prevent a potential customer from clicking to a competitor, recommendations must be contextual and instantaneous. Running in Neo4j, Bechtleâ€™s recommendation system generates a detailed model of all the actions customers take on the website.

### 3. Bill of Materials

Tracking every component and its cost, what equipment the components relate to, and the expected product lifespan or average time to failure into a bill of materials is a behemoth operation for an organization.

### 4. Track & Trace

Graph data models enable traceability for a variety of industries and use cases. Track and trace enables you to find out the status of a product.

### 5. Network & IT Ops

Graph databases are a natural fit for network and IT ops. The graph's connected structure enables network managers to conduct sophisticated impact analyses. A simple graph query determines which applications, services, and customers will be affected if a particular network element fails.

Digital transformation requires modernizing the IT landscape and demands crystal clear visibility into current systems.
